# Agriaquaponics
Agriquaponics is a sustainable farming method that integrates aquaculture (the raising of fish) and hydroponics (the cultivation of plants in water) and agriculture (the cultivation of plants in soil). In our project it consists of one fish tank, two chambers for crops cultivation (One in the water directly i.e. topmost layer (chamber) and another on soil i.e. in middle layer(chamber)). The aquaponics system operates as a closed-loop ecosystem, Water from the fish tanks containing fish waste is pumped into the grow beds where plants are cultivated. As the plants absorb nutrients, they purify the water, which is then recirculated back to the fish tanks through biofilter which will collect the waste that may be further reused or is washed out. This aquaponics is equipped with smart sensors like measuring temperature and humidity of farm area and soil moisture (middle layer) and as well as checks for continuous flow of water, this will also give alert to owner for real-time data. And all these data will also be displayed in LCD using ESP8266 microcontroller (which is Wi-Fi module.

. Technology and Components used:

1. DHT11: Temperature and Humidity Sensor to measure the temperature of Farm area.

2. Soil Moisture Sensor: Measure soil moisture of soil based sub-system

3. Water flow Sensor: It check status of continuous water supply as well as pump status

4. Water level Sensor: To detect water level of tank.

5. Servomotor: To divert water flow to soil based sub-system.

6. Alert System: To give alert if any problem or issue occurs.

7. Oxygen Mixture: Mix oxygen into water and maintain water oxygen level.

8. Pump Driver: To drive water pump.

9. ESP8266: It is Wi-Fi based microcontroller that control over all operations in agriquoponics and send data to server.

10. LCD Display: It displays over all process going on in the system.

11. Website: It integrates project data to the website. It will give real-time data update to client or user about the process going on in the system.
